# MixamoSouls

Example project for __Action Adventure Kit 1.0.1__

this is a minimal project demonstrating how a character from mixamo may be integrated into AAK

the AAK asset itself is required but gitignored so when first opening the project enter safe mode and import AAK from the project manager
